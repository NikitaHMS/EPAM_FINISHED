Create a program which manages a car park. For this purpose, you need to implement the next entities as separate classes: "Engine" (includes the next fields: power, volume, type, serial number), "Chassis" (wheels number, number, permissible load), "Transmission" (type, number of gears, manufacturer).

Implement entities "Passenger car", "Truck", "Bus", "Scooter" using class described previously (distinguished by unique fields) and provide the output of complete information about objects of these types.
